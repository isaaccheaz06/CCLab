                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Specters are geometric entities that replicate the forms of creatures from different worlds. The
                    Specter described here takes the shape of a butterfly. Although they mimic the forms of living
                    beings, all Specters share a distinct feature: an exposed, beating heart. They inhabit a tranquil,
                    dark dimension and react strongly when disturbed, creating illusions and presenting the illusion of
                    multiple fused creatures.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The Specter resides in a dark dimension populated by geometric shapes. This environment is peaceful,
                    with minimal illumination and occasional wormholes leading to other worlds. Specters sustain
                    themselves on light—however minimal. There is no food chain, no predators or prey in this dimension;
                    instead, Specters spend their entire lives wandering through the void, sometimes interacting with
                    one another.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Specters take on the forms of beings from other dimensions. However, the only part of their body that
                    is truly their own is their heart. The Specter documented here has copied the form of a butterfly.
                    They are shy creatures—when approached, their heart glows bright red, and their heartbeat
                    accelerates. While some Specters may have more complex designs with additional lines, the one
                    discovered consists of nine circles and fourteen connecting lines. Despite mimicking other
                    creatures, Specters lack the ability to replicate their colors and finer details, resulting in a
                    hollow, skeletal appearance.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A heart that beats faster when approached.</li>
                    <li>Highly geometric structure—transforms mimicked creatures into simplified but recognizable
                        geometric forms.</li>
                    <li>Creates illusions when disturbed.</li>
                    <li>Wanders through the abyss, occasionally interacting with other Specters.</li>
                    <li>Requires light to survive, though only in small amounts.</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Specters?</span>
                Specters are solitary beings that roam the abyss, occasionally encountering others of their kind. They
                are naturally formless, only taking shape when passing through wormholes into other dimensions. Their
                forms are simplified, "geometricized" versions of the creatures they mimic, retaining the same movement
                and behaviors as their originals. The most distinct feature of all Specters is their exposed, beating
                heart—the one trait they all share.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Move your mouse close to
                its heart to make it beat faster and turn red, signifying the creature’s nervousness. You can also
                interact with the environment—dragging your mouse (while holding down click) will create ripples in the
                background, disturbing the Specter and prompting it to react by generating illusions.
